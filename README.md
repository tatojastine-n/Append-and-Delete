# Append-and-Delete
This C# program checks if one string can be transformed into another using exactly `k` append or delete operations. It finds the common prefix, calculates the minimum required operations, and returns "Yes" if `k` allows the transformation, otherwise "No". The `Main` method handles input and output.
